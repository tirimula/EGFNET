# EGFNet-V4: Enhanced Gear Fault Detection

Implementation of **Enhanced Gear Fault Net Using Squeeze Group and Depthwise Convolutions with Grad-CAM**.

## Overview
EGFNet-V4 uses Constant-Q Transform spectrograms, grouped/depthwise convolutions, receptive field attention, and squeeze-aggregated excitation to detect gearbox faults. Grad-CAM is used for model interpretability.

## Highlights
- 96.03% Accuracy on SpectraQuest and CWRU datasets
- Advanced CNN with attention and excitation modules
- Grad-CAM visualization for decision transparency

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install: `pip install tensorflow librosa scikit-learn matplotlib`
3. Open and run `Enhanced Gear Fault Net.ipynb`.
